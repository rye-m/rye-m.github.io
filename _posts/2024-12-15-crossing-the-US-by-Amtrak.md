# Crossing the USA by train

I took Amtrak trains to go back to New York City from Los Angeles which took 73(?) hours in total. Here is the route.

### First Segment:
- Los Angeles to Chicago
- 45 hours 

I like this segment the most because there was less people, lots of great views, great trains, and great crews.

The capacity rate of our cabin was less than 30% (until we got to Kansas).
Since there was less people, I could use diner car without making reservation! I had breakfast, lunch and dinner there and it was greaaat!!

Since this train was a ["Superliner"](https://amtrakguide.com/2022/01/06/superliner-trains-layout-routes/), it had a second floor where my seat was located, all the bathrooms and the luggage room was in downstairs.
And the two greatest things about this Superliner are the lounge and the bathroom!!

The view from the train was amazing!! 1st day, it was sunny and I saw lots of great canyons!

Finally, arrived in Chicago!

### Second Segment:
- Chicago to Washington D.C.
- 26 hours


This time the train did't have a second floor which means they doesn't have a cool bathroom...
