# Crossing the USA by train

I took Amtrak trains to go back to New York City from Los Angeles which took 73(?) hours in total. Here is the route.

### First Segment:
- Los Angeles to Chicago
- 45 hours 

I like this segment the most because there was less people, lots of great views, great trains, and great crews.

The capacity rate of our cabin was less than 30% (until we got to Kansas).
Since there was less people, I could use diner car without making reservation! I had breakfast, lunch and dinner there and it was greaaat!!

Since this train was ["A Superliner"](https://amtrakguide.com/2022/01/06/superliner-trains-layout-routes/), it had second floor where my seat was located and all the bathroom and luggage room were in  downstairs.
And the two greatest thing about this Superliner are the lounge and the bathroom!!

### Second Segment:
- Chicago to Washington D.C.
- 26 hours


This time the train doesn't have second floor which means they doesn't have the cool bathroom...
