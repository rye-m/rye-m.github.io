# Party and Poetry Camera

On the cold day in Mid-December, I joined a party my friends and his roommates host.

There were lots of people who have different background and one of them was the creater of the "Poetry Camera".


This camera emmets a paper a poem is written, instead of picture. It can create a poem based on what the lens capture.

I asked my friends to take a picture (I'm not sure if this is right expression to use since it doesn't "take a picure") and the following is the poem it created.

11:01 PM  
In gentle glow of shaded lamp, you stand,  
A cap frames your delight, glasses perched true.  
The plate in hand, a feast crafted warm and grand,  
Reflects the joy-that quiet, simple hue.  
Books lean against each other, spine to spine,  
Walls bear the stories that have whispered close,  
In this embrace where comfortable lines  
Dissolve all hints of sharp edges. Repose.  
Your smile, it softens shadowed corners deep,  
Turns empty spaces into welcome homes.  
In this dim room, away from tangled sleep,  
A harmony of evening's calming tones.  
In every glance, your heart's wide-open room,  
That gentle vibe, amidst this cozy bloom.

Since this is super sweet and beautiful, I want to create something with this poem on it!
